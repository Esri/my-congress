## Congress Map

The my-congress project is a quick-turnaround development project aimed at building a focused app that makes it easy for citizens to discover and learn about their elected representatives.  The app is a refined and updated version of a demo app available [here] (http://107.20.167.42/congress/)

### Functional Capabilities
- A user needs to discover information about the elected officials in a given congressional district
- A user can select a congressional district or can enter an address, zip code, etc. to locate a given district
- A user is provided basic contact information, photograph and other available metadata about the legislators in the selected district
- Legislators are listed from a selected district from the House and the Senate
- A user can tap an official and know what committees the legislator is a member of while the map shows the district boundary
- A user can tap on a committee and get metadata information about other legislators that participate in the given committee while the map highlights all the districts represented by the committee meembers
- The app should adhere to responsive design principals to work well on tablet and desktop browsers at a minimum and ideally on a modern mobile device browser as well

### External Resources
- Congressional information will be accessed through the Sunlight Congress [API] (http://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/index.html)
- Accessing the Sunlight API requires a key for all requests. Key is free and accessible [here] (http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/accounts/register/)
