# My Congress

The my-congress project is a quick-turnaround development project aimed at building a focused app that makes it easy for citizens to discover and learn about their elected representatives.

## Features

* Runs in the Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer browsers ([supported browsers][], except IE 11) on browser screens from phone through tablet to desktop. (Find, Edit, and Filter is currently for desktop only.)
* Permits multiple levels of customization:
    1. publication configuration: titles and icons by configuring the web application using the standard ArcGIS online configuration program
    2. advanced configuration: adjustment of application styles and content, visibility of components
    3. unlimited modifications to the open source

The first two levels can be done whether the app is hosted on your server or in ArcGIS Online.

Currently, two application configurations are provided:

* Finder (formerly called Parcel Viewer) *[preview the application][FinderPreview]*
* Find, Edit, and Filter *[preview the application][FEFPreview]*
